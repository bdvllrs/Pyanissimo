# Pyanissimo
LSTM Network that generates music using theano.

## Some infos
Make sure you have a 
- `data` folder 
- `data/snapshot`

in the project (to save the weights and biases).
See the wiki to learn more about the Neural Net Class we made.

## Dependencies
- python >= 3.4
- theano (http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html)
- tkinter
- numpy
- cuda (if you want to use Nvindia GPU)

## Use GPU
